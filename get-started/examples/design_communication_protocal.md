## Design Communication Protocol

### Why design communication protocol

The TCP protocol is connection oriented. Once established, the data can be sent bidirectional. It rearranges data packets in the order specified. Unlike UDP, the data transported by TCP is read as a “stream” with nothing to distinguish the packet end and front. And there may be multiple packets through per read.

When the applications want to use TCP to exchange data, it needs to use or design the protocol over TCP to solve the problem of distinguishing packets. There are many commonly used protocols over TCP, for instance, HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP3, etc.

Except for those commonly used protocols, you can design customized protocol according to your application. For designing protocol, the most important is how to distinguish the boundary between packets. There are two examples of customized protocol.

### Customized Protocol

#### EOF terminator protocol

This protocol adds a specified string in the end of every packet to represent the boundary of the packet. For example, the memcache, ftp and stmp use the `\r\n` as terminator. If the protocol use the `\r\n` as terminator, there mustn't be `\r\n` in the data.

It is easy to use EOF terminator protocol in swoole by setting the corresponding parameters.

```php
$server->set(array(
	'open_eof_split' => true,
	'package_eof' => "\r\n",
));

$client->set(array(
	'open_eof_split' => true,
	'package_eof' => "\r\n",
));

```

#### Fixed packet head and body protocol

This protocol devides the packet to two parts, head and body. The length of head is fixed. And one of parameter in the head indicates the whole length of the packet. When the server receives this kind of packet, it can control the length of reading from the data stream according to the head.

It is easy to set this kind of protocol in swoole by setting the corresponding parameters. When this kind of protocol has been set, the receive event isn't triggered until the server or client receive a full packet.

```php
$server->set(array(
	'open_length_check' => true,
	'package_max_length' => 81920,
	'package_length_type' => 'n', //see php pack()
	'package_length_offset' => 0,
	'package_body_offset' => 2,
));
```
