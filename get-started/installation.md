##### Steps of Compilation 

The process of compile and install the swoole extension for PHP

``` bash
cd swoole          #  enter the directory of swoole source code   
phpize       	   #  prepare the build environment for a PHP extension
./configure        #  add configuration paramaters as needed
make 			   #  a successful result of make is swoole/module/swoole.so
sudo make install  #  install the swoole into the PHP extensions directory
```

### Enable swoole

After installing the swoole extension to the PHP extensions directory, you will need to edit php.ini and add an extension=swoole.so line before you can use the swoole extension.

```bash
php -i | grep php.ini                      # check the php.ini file location
sudo echo "extension=swoole.so" > php.ini  # add the extension=swoole.so to the end of php.ini
php -m | grep swoole                       # check if the swoole extension has been enabled
```
